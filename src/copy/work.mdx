for the creation of the MB&A and Generalist Credit New to Role
Training Plan for Credit Managers. My Line Manager and I proactively
identified the need to refresh the existing training plans which were
used within GLT. The plan included bespoke drop down menus which are
specific to the role of the individual and provides time bound actions
which include technical skills, Credit Skills Development and the
wider aspects of the role including understanding the ethos and
culture of Business Banking Risk. The plan incorporates a
comprehensive library facility for direct access to relevant documents
and web links. The training plan was delivered in a tight timescale to
universal praise from the recipients. The impact of the quality of the
plan was so great that it was immediately adopted as 'best in breed'
by wider Risk teams and HR. The feedback has been excellent, although
the best evidence of the quality of this piece of proactive work is
the speed and diversity of its wide spread adoption. A piece of work
which allows Business Banking Risk to set the pace in providing
professional and comprehensive development .This is a first class
example of real obsession with making Business Risk a world class
environment to work in.
