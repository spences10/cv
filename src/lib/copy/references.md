## Testimonials

> Scott understands business needs and rapidly meets all requirements.
> He is great to work with and would be great on any project

-- Sandra Penfold

> Scott picked up a difficult technical concept relating to the
> reconciliation of multiple financial products very quickly,
> including financial derivatives. Very unusually, he also had to do
> this whilst learning and applying SQL database programming in an
> investment banking sales environment where the only choice was
> self-directed learning and working without support. Scott was
> excellent - self-supporting, motivated, quick to learn and focused
> on delivery. I would not only recommend him, I would seek to work
> with him again in the future. Ah, if only he hadn't left the
> company...

-- Paul Gorman
